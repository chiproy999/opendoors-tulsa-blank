            Open Doors Tulsa exists to create pathways to sustainable employment and stable housing for individuals with arrest or conviction histories. I'm dedicated to reducing recidivism, fostering economic mobility, and building a more inclusive Tulsa.

            <li>Every individual has the opportunity to rebuild their life after involvement with the criminal justice system</li>
            <li>Employers recognize the value and potential of hiring individuals with conviction histories</li>
            <li>Housing providers implement fair screening practices that consider the whole person</li>
            <li>The stigma associated with having a conviction history is replaced with a culture of second chances</li>
            <li>Recidivism rates decrease through increased access to stable employment and housing</li>

                  My journey is a testament to the power of transformation. As a former inmate, I've experienced firsthand how someone can turn their life around and become a moral, upstanding citizen. That's why I started Open Doors Tulsa - because I believe in second chances and know that people can change. This platform exists to help others find the opportunities they need to rebuild their lives, just as I was able to do with the support of others who believed in me.
